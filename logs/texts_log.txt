**Nasty
Hello, Nasty!
what seems to be the trouble?
**i need to talk about my feelings
i completely understand you
**it is about love and relationship
that must mean you really do love and care about you.
**i feel a lot of lonely last time
your friends care a lot of you and that's exactly where those shootings happen.
**sometimes i miss my friends
it sounds like you really miss your sweet beast.
**i miss my family, i haven't seen them for a long time
there's never too much: you can always find someone online or a therapist who you haven't had one in forever.
**it is too hard to fall in love with somebody
but, you can't help who you fall in love with.
**but i have no regrets about the past
i am glad you have no regrets.
**i were super brave in relationship but now i'm afraid
please continue
**i have such good friends in my life
im glad you have such good friends in your life, it makes plans for you.
**but now nobody can help me with my trouble
hope you find something that can help you with that amount and when you have you can repay them back.
**i hope you can understand the need
oh i can understand the feeling.
**recently i broke up with my boyfriend
just broke up with my ex-gf months ago.
**i don't know if i can still be friends
it is interesting and i should think more about it
**i constantly look back the past
i had only played the leaked beta from back in the day i feel it's our responsibility to take care of, they blindly accept anything.
**i wish i have found some healing
i hope you have found some healing and closure to the difficulties it caused when you were younger.
**i wish i could stay in contact with him
i hope you can stay in contact with him.
**i still deal with stress
although i still deal with stress occasionally, i know exactly what you mean.
**being with someone is important for me
would you like to tell me more about it?
**i want to be comfortable and enjoy my company
being with someone isn't everything, be comfortable and enjoy your own company and love will come when you least expect it:.
**i have very rough breakups
sounds like you have a very responsible young lady growing up.
**no, i have been through rough breakups
friends i know who have been through rough breakups often say that physical activity helps.
**my friends can be annoying
i hope you he changes some so you can still be friends.
**i'm afraid of trying again
please go on
**may be i just need some time
sometimes you just need some time and some growth before you can revisit mistakes that have happened.
**but my mistakes is awful
i can understand your feelings; but i suspect you made the right choice and you will always be glad you went.
**i hope the pain will pass
i'm sure with time the pain will pass.
**but i become older and older
no any more he is a lot older and does pretty good on his own, but the thing is he is always close by if we in the store together.
**i am trying to forget all this working hard 
many people have the same sorts of feelings
**working hard helos me
she is probably working hard to provide a better life for the family.
**i need someone compassionate
im always here if you need someone to join in, just let me know.
**i hope i will have good relationship
i hope you will have a lot of responsibility there.
**goodbye
