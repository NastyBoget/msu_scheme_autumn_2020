who are you?
**Nasty
Hello, Nasty!
what seems to be the trouble?
**i need to talk about my feelings
if we talk about good and bad uniqueness.
**it is about love and relationship
it is rather that of students.
**i feel a lot of lonely last time
i completely understand you
**sometimes i miss my friends
comparing yourself to someone else who you are involved.
**i miss my family, i haven't seen them for a long time
this promise was made two weeks before the marriage; the very idea of a psychological level, i do this only for something to be learned from existentialism is the attitude to psychosis, does not have that transient character that is common for a meaning - life can be of significant help.
**it is to hard to fall in love with somebody
after all, it is.
**but i have no regrets about the past
although questions about the reality principle is not a neurotic distortion of primary human motivation, as meaningless as reproduction.
**i were super brave in relationship but now i'm afraid
not seeing the uniqueness of my lecture tours in the sense of some valley, but to understand your problem not as a result of its object something that needs to be done: i'm talking about noogenic neurosis, and nothing less than this opportunity of a more worthy expression in mountaineering - this is especially evident in a book that was really successful.
**i have such good friends in my life
in reality i am, you have fewer neuroses than americans, i love to compare this need not be, this formulation summarizes much in the economic situation of the totality of objects, that is needed to help whenever he can even be physical.
**but now nobody can help me with my trouble
until i can help him develop independence of thought and action.
**i hope you can understand the need
please go on
**recently i broke up with my boyfriend
at some moments life calls us to see and emphasize, is free to choose from a therapeutic practice based on his not only an extension of it that he is in this case, the doctor will have completely certain traits and certain inclinations, with the kaleidoscope itself, so that in research in this case, we would probably end up with the fact that each specific case.
**i don't know if we can still be friends
the function of such a situation where his impotence becomes the only path to inner freedom for the most we can recall our case with the means of realizing a value, if he strives for pleasure underlies many sexual neuroses.
**i constantly look back the past
the woman often spoke of the past, they say, space.
**i wish i have found some healing
they have found meaning in the one who loves, and he runs away from what is revealed in a meeting with another unique person, we would miss all the same time, the patient to accept the many years that imitation of treatment lasted - the center of spiritual existence, which cannot be a devalued insignificance.
**i wish i could stay in contact with him
an instinct that has freed himself from everything except the experienced moment, which he found in the midst of the psychiatrist has to do - is then firmly associated with circumstances not simply inherent in him and arranged for him to me about this from vietnam: i will never converge entirely - there will only consider sexual intercourse with him her cannot be changed - otherwise it would become impossible to change your attitude to the highest sense of dissonance between what is in many ways.
**i still deal with stress
we need humility to deal with the case against himself.
**being with someone is important for me
consider a number of ganglion cells does not distinguish him as with someone, a person is able to understand the expression of spiritual life does not care about the meaning of an unbeliever, saying that i had to call on the whole tree.
**i want to be comfortable and enjoy my company
the impotence of the values of the fear of being bound and trying to match the fashionable type, and in favor of continuing with wide-open eyes to look at the university of vienna, who experience life in general, and on the street actually experiences meanings and their loved ones were not convinced that the elimination of the spiritual and the resulting reduction and cessation of suffering from a similar picture is different with the transfer of true love is directed towards some meaning, higher dimension, conscience is to be extremely effective in the past.
**i have very rough breakups
would you like to tell me more about it?
**no, i have been trough rough breakups
of course, namely, he inevitably makes it an object or a telescope, you only see the creator in himself, falling into the spiritual character, and not just a human being.
**my friends can be annoying
what can be called voluntarily: i was invited to give them to pull this victim out of life depends on how much more appropriate here is an ideal to himself, falling into the question of meaning, will ultimately turn out to be able to change it.
**i'm afraid of trying again
human freedom is always the last before what it is enough to imagine that such universal laws in the light of which, in a sense of inner completeness and integrity inherent in people of the i'm afraid, the existential vacuum as a model, kaleidoscopism paints a picture of human phenomena from subhuman and reduce human phenomena.
**may be i just need some time
now, with the tasks are different for different interpretations, so one has succeeded in transforming a circle into a direct and inevitable element of reality as such a patient to accept it, he continues to constantly move along the ground: it can be filled not only on whether we now turn to art for examples: we just need to prove worthy of realization, not from excess but from lack of oxygen can be so.
**but mistakes is awful
pleasure is not the only thing that supported him internally was the one that no one comes to evaluating human actions, the realization of his own life.
**i hope the pain will pass
the patient that she failed to understand and agree; of course, she can, whenever young people, after a public lecture that i recognize the simple fact that the prisoners, writes one of the person may have to conclude that an unattractive person will avenge the pain that awaits us in this case, each person has for the patient should really leave his diplomatic career and go to bed to recuperate.
**but i become older and older
in this case, the arguments that death ultimately makes life completely meaningless, but you may have to suffer.
**i am trying to forget all this working hard
please continue
**working hard helps me
the more pleasure a person who, working hard throughout the life of healthy and sick people.
**i need someone compassionate
but if i do not see a burning lamp, the young doctor developed melanosarcoma, and striving, on the other hand, with his friend, saying: you need to earn money, that this is true of freedom.
**i hope i will have good relationship
he will have another opportunity to fulfill his destiny, embodied logos.
**goodbye
Goodbye, Nasty!

time to go home
